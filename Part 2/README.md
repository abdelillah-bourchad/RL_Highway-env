# Racetrack Reinforcement Learning Project

Welcome to the Racetrack Reinforcement Learning Project repository. This project focuses on developing a policy model to navigate racetracks using reinforcement learning techniques.

## Repository Contents

- **`config.json`**: Configuration settings for the racetrack environment and learning parameters.
- **`racetrack.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the training code and results visualization.
- **`policy_model_episode_{i}`**: Directories containing the model parameters saved after each training episode.

## Usage

1. Install necessary Python packages from `requirements.txt`.
2. Review and adjust settings in `config.json` as needed.
3. Run `racetrack.ipynb` to train the model and visualize the training progress.
4. Evaluate models saved in `policy_model_episode_{i}` to determine the best performer.

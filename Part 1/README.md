# Highway Reinforcement Learning Project

Welcome to the Highway Reinforcement Learning Project repository. This project focuses on developing a policy model to navigate using reinforcement learning techniques.

## Repository Contents


- **`Highway_DQN.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the training code and results visualization.
- **`highway_DQN_Model_{i}`**: Files containing the model parameters saved after each training episode.
- **`result_episode_[i].gif`**: Results of the agent for the model 93 (2 files for 2 different test)

## Usage

1. Install necessary Python packages.
3. Run `Highway_DQN.ipynb` to train the model and visualize the training progress.
4. Evaluate models saved in `highway_DQN_Model_{i}` to determine the best performer.

# Reinforcement Learning Project 

This repository is a collaborative effort showcasing the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to different driving scenarios, divided into three distinct parts. Each part addresses a unique problem in the domain of autonomous vehicles using various RL techniques.

## Project Structure

- **`Part 1`**: Focuses on highway driving with a discrete environment. It explores the basic concepts of reinforcement learning applied to driving behaviors on a highway.

- **`Part 2`**: Deals with the racetrack problem, implementing a policy model to navigate complex racetracks. A detailed walkthrough is provided in the corresponding folder, including configuration, training, and result visualization.

- **`Part 3`**:Tackles the intersection problem using a deep Q-network (DQN). It demonstrates advanced techniques in reinforcement learning to manage intersection navigation and traffic.

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the necessary Python packages to install for running the project code.

- **`Reinforcement_Learning_Project.pdf`**: A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, results, and analysis for each part of the project.

## Instructions

Each part contains a `README.md` file providing specific instructions and explanations. Please refer to these files for detailed guidance on running the simulations and understanding the implementations.

## Contributions

- **Abdellilah BOURCHAD**: Implemented the racetrack navigation problem in `Part 2`.
- **Mohamed Aziz TRIKI**: Worked on the intersection problem using DQN in `Part 3`.
- **Lotfi KACHA**: Contributed to highway driving in a discrete environment in `Part 1`.
- **Ibrahim RAMDANE**: Contributed to highway driving in a discrete environment in `Part 1`.
